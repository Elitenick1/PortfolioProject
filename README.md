# PortfolioProject
Helo hello. This is my portfolio project where I show what I have to offer to imaginary employers.
# Challenges
It was very hard to figure out how to do glitch animation text. I did use a couple youtube guides and in the end I synthesized them to get my current effect.
# What you can actually see
I ended up ditching the glitch because I found it annoying and not in the color theme that I wanted. I was also sick for 3 days so I legit had nothing until the last day. The current website you see was made in 6 hours in one night(not fun). I do regret procrasinating. What you currently see is what I am proud enough to show. I had a lot of other things planned but I didnt like how they looked and performed so I got rid of them.
